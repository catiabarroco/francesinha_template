      <p>
        Francesinha is a sandwich from the city of Porto, in Portugal.
        <br /><br />
        The francesinha in its special francesinha sandwich variation is more
        commonly made up of sausage, fresh sausage, ham, cold meats and beef
        steak, topped with later melted cheese. It is garnished with a tomato,
        beer and piri-piri-based sauce and can be served with French fries as an
        accompaniment. The addition of a fried egg on top of the sandwich is an
        increasingly recurrent fact, and this practice constitutes a change to
        the original recipe. In some houses, the so-called normal francesinha is
        served without steak.
